# Public-Key-Infrastructure-PKI-Deployment

<h3>Business Case</h3>
Establish a secure and scalable PKI framework to manage encryption and digital certificates.

<h3>Overview</h3>
Deployed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) solutions to secure organizational com-munications and data sharing.


<h3>Key Contributions</h3>

Configured Certificate Authorities (CAs) and issued certificates.

Automated certificate renewal processes.

Monitored and analyzed certificate usage for compliance.

<h3>Results: </h3>
Improved encryption and authentication processes across systems.

<h3>Tools & Environment: </h3>
Microsoft PKI, OpenSSL, Windows Server.

<h3>Workflow Placeholder:</h3>
Setup Certificate Authority → Issue Certificates → Monitor Usage → Renew Certificates

<h3>Visual Placeholder: </h3>
Diagram showing PKI components from CA setup to certificate lifecycle.
